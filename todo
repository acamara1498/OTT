To do (in order of importance):
⁃Figure out the weights for sadness function
⁃Refine the filtering for the similarity function
-find one more search algorithm
⁃Choose 3 search algorithms:
  ⁃Greedy
  ⁃BFS
  ⁃DFS
  ⁃A*
⁃Design and implement an evaluation function for the above algorithms (sum of sadness over list)
⁃Comment code
⁃Write paper
⁃Design and implement a simple UI
